### What I learned

I started this challenge because I wanted to reinforce previous knowledge and also because I could do it in a short time.



### Continued development

My aim now is to use this reinforcement to improve my learning of other technologies, right now i'm focusing on react and this will help for sure.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I consider this the best documentation in this matter out there
